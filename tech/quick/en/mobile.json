    "description":"Mobile devices are any device that is designed to be moved to and used in a remote location or away from a statick, controlled location, such as in the cases of: during field work, while traveling, remote work/work from home, or for business communications such as company enabled smartphones.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Mobile is a concern for deperimiterization in organizations.",
        "Mobile devices are a concern for remote business connections back to the intranet, but also for malicious use of unauthorized mobile devices on-premesis.",
        "BYOD (Bring your own device) is a mobile deployment method in which a user uses their own personal mobile device for business functions.",
        "BYOD is the least secure, but cheapest option for an organization.",
        "COBO (Company Owned Business Only) is a mobile deployment method in which the business purchaes, configures, and supplies the mobile device which is only authorized for business use, and may be configured to allow only business functions.",
        "COBO is the most expensive, but most secure mobile deployment option.",
        "COPE (Company Owned Personally Enabled) is a mobile deployment method in which the device is purchased and configured by they company, but the user is allowed to install and use some personal services on the device.",
        "COPE is still expensive for the company and is less secure than COBO, but more secure than BYOD or CYOD.",
        "CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) is a mobile deployment option in which a user is able to choose which personally enabled device they purchase (usually subsidized) from a pre-approved list of devices that will be allowed for business functions. The device is still personally managed and enabled, but the hardware and operating system is considered sufficiently secure.",
        "CYOD is more secure than BYOD but less secure than COPE and COBO, and is less expensive than COPE/COBO but may be more expensive than BYOD.",
        "Managed Mobile Services (MMS) allows a vendor or third-party to automatically configure devices for the organization on first boot, automatically donloading security policies and setting up MDM before allowing set up to continue.",
        "Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a software application on mobile devices that automatically maintains, updates, and enforces security and device policies on the mobile device based on organizational policy. MDM strictly enforces policy on endpoints.",
        "Compartmentalization is the logical segmentation of mobile device operations that separates business and personal applications and data, securing and encrypting them separately and preventing cross communication between the two compartments.",
        "Encryption is critical to mobile devices; most devices offer full drive encryption of some sort.",
        "Mobile devices can and should be configured for remote wipe so that data can be completely erased by a remote signal if the device is lost or stolen.",
        "Geofencing restricts device actions, or explicitly permits actions, when the device is located in certain geographic locations; geofencing requires location services enabeld."
