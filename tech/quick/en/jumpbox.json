    "description":"A jump server, jump host or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "A single, security hardened system that is the only connection between a trusted/secured network and an untrusted network.",
        "Should be the only device connected to the security zone with a connection to another network.",
        "Preferred vs. firewalls when an operating system is needed to run specialize software that interacts directly with systems/appliances on the secure network area.",
        "Increases security by reducing attack surface and reducing the amount of maintenance needed to keep secure."
