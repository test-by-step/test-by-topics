    "description":"Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Spiral allows for rapid development and iterative release of new software versions",
        "Each release has a clear set of objectives to deliver.",
        "Spiral is organized as a series of cycles, where each cycle is a release.",
        "Each cycle has four phases: Objective Setting, Risk Assessment, Development, Planning.",
        "The development phase incorporates many of the phases of the waterfall method: design, code, integrate, test, implement.",
        "Objectives are clearly defined within each release cycle, which permits for a structured sequential approach to delivering on the cycles objectives.",
        "Spiral models are risk driven, risk is assessed and addressed at each cycle."
