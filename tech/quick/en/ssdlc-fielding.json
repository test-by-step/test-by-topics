        "Software should be validated in a separate staging environment.",
        "Test with SAST, DAST, or IAST prior to release.",
        "Changes and releases should be thoroughly documented along with each fielding.",
        "A bug tracking system should be used to manage and address serious issues.",
        "Code signing should be used to provide integrity checks of release bundles for customers.",
        "A simple and secure security patching mechanism should be implemented."
