    "title":"Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)",
    "description":"A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure. A VPC gives an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Publicly provided but privately used cloud network.",
        "VPCs are not the same as private clouds, but a privatized virtual network hosted by a public cloud provider.",
        "Software Defined Networking (SDN) overlays the logical virtual network definition over existing hardware, without the need to alter the hardware's physical configuration.",
        "Specify virtual routers, switches, interfaces, subnets, VLANs as well as virtual links (wires) connecting all the network devices and virtual services, servers, and VMs.",
        "Reduced cost, increased scalability, reduced management overhead, efficient security controls.",
        "SDN allows for efficient security controls such as easy traffic mirroring and dynamicly isolated infected networks in real-time.",
        "VPCs can often be defined using Infrastructure as Code, defining the expected logical arrangement in configuration files that can be easily deployed and modified."
