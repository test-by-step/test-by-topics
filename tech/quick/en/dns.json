        "Resolves a domain name or URL to an internet routable address (IP address).",
        "Basic operation is over UDP port 53.",
        "Basic operation is not encrypted nor authenticated or validated (no confidentiality or integrity).",
        "Servers may support additional protocols such as TCP.",
        "Servers may support encrypted connections over HTTPS or TLS.",
        "DNSSEC can provide authenticated records (to prevent spoofing or poisoning) but do not encrypt the request or response.",
        "Recursive requests are served by recursively making DNS requests to lower and lower level servers until an authoritative answer is returned.",
        "Iterative requests are served by returning the best answer immediatelly available, or a reference to the next most authoritative server at a lower level.",
        "Non-recursive requests are served by either directly returning an authoritative answer or a cached answer.",
        "Resolvers are the first DNS server accessed by a requester, typically a recursive resolver, and typically on a wireless router, internet gateway, or ISP.",
        "Recursive servers are responsible for making recursive requests, starting at a root domain server, and following DNS responses at every level until an authoritative answer is returned.",
        "Authoritative servers are the servers where DNS records are officially stored and can return an authoritative answer, since they are the server ultimately responsible for that record.",
        "A records return the IP address for a domain name.",
        "AAAA records return the IPv6 address for a domain name.",
        "CNAME records are aliases for the domain name/IP address requested, and direct to another record (often another A record) to detirmine the IP address.",
        "PTR records are the reverse of A records, returning a domain name when an IP address is specified.",
        "MX records specify the mail server for a domain name, usually looking and acting like a CNAME record, but logically identifying mail servers.",
        "Wildcard records can group all subdomains of a specified domain into a single record."
