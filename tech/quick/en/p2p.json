    "description":"Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Clients are connected directly to each other, without a centralized server.",
        "Application processing and file hosting occurs on the client devices, without a centralized server.",
        "Each node in the network is equally privileged.",
        "P2P operates at the application layer as a virtual network overlay; using TCP/IP and other Internet protocols to communicate but connecting themseelves via Layer 7 (Application).",
        "Unstructured P2P networks allow for easy joining and leaving of the network (high churn), but resource queries ahve to be flooded to the entire network.",
        "Structured P2P networks use Distributed Hash Tables to efficiently look up resources, but joining and leaving the topology is more difficult as synchronization to the topology and DHT is required.",
        "Early versions of SMB are susceptible to the EternalBlue attack; SMBv3 is the most current and secure version.",
        "Relay nodes in the P2P network can be used to get arround NATs that would typically prevent clients from being directly routable from the Internet.",
        "Examples: BitTorrent, Skype, SMB, Bitcoin"
