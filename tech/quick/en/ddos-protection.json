        "Blackhole filtering routes DDoS traffic to a null interface, silently dropping the connection so that it doesn't take up any more resources.",
        "Load balancing can reduce the impact of massive numbers of connections by spreading the computation load amongst a pool of back-end servers.",
        "SOAR can help to trigger a defense and begin filtering DDoS traffic early by automatically triggering complicated responses.",
        "Remote Triggered Black Hole filtering helps to filter DDoS traffic by signaling edge network devices to drop DDoS traffic before it enters the internal network and begins demanding resources.",
        "Content delivery networks can assist in mitigating DDoS by servering static content from multiple dispersed servers across a large geographic area.",
        "Cloud providers can provide automatic scaling to reduce the impact of DDoS.",
        "Reflection, amplification, and spoofing attacks impose additional challenges as effective and smart source address filtering is needed so that a self imposed DDoS is not affected.",
        "Stateful firewalls can assist in dropping common protocol based DoS attacks that may be used in a DDoS attack, but is not in itself sufficent to mitigate a Distributed attack."
