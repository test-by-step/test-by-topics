    "description":"In software engineering, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Service Oriented Architecture is an integrating feature, spanning multiple parts of an organization.",
        "It allows the reuse of functionality of multiple applications that service multiple facets of an organization.",
        "SOA connects multiple applications to reuse features; microservices by contrast typically provide granular access to an individual applications functions, rather than service reuse across applications.",
        "An ESB can be used to provide an abstraction for SOA applications, rather than communicating directly between service interfaces.",
        "SOA can break down application features and functions into multiple components which may be reused across multiple applications.",
        "Single repeatable function.",
        "Self contained.",
        "Black box.",
        "Typically stateless."
