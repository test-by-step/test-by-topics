    "description":"In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.[1] A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Basic firewalls operate at OSI Network (3) Layer, NGFW/UTM will operate at more layers.",
        "Stateful or stateless.",
        "Pre-defined list of rules, evaluated for each packet sequentially.",
        "Implied deny is common, otherwise 'deny all' at the end is a typically desirable.",
        "Typically protects networks (as apposed to applications or services).",
        "Stateless firewalls evaluate each packet individually, without tracking or remembering sessions or other context.",
        "Stateful firewalls remember state information and can filter based on context (not necessarily packet context) such as if the source has too many open connections or incomplete TCP handshakes.",
        "Next Generation Firewalls aim to operate at more levels of the OSI model (up to Application).",
        "NGFW and UTMs can provide many more services on top of routing and filtering such as anti-virus, anti-malware, DLP.",
        "UTM and NGFW are sometimes used interchangeably, but UTMs are more likely to distinguished as a comprehensive and immutable suite on a single device.",
        "NGFWs typically can't inspect or filter on encrypted content (such as HTTPS)."
