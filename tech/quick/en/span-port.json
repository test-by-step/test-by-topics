    "description":"Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) is switch specific tool that copies Ethernet frames passing through switch ports and send these frames out to specific port.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link); almost always associated with switches (as opposed to bridges or hubs, which would be better described as network taps).",
        "Copies all traffic from specified interfaces to a single isolated interface.",
        "Used by IDSs and network monitors to view and aggregate traffic that would otherwise be logically segmented by VLANs.",
        "Remote SPAN ports are possible using either 802.1Q VLAN headers to trunk traffic across layer 2, or using tunneling over IP on layer 3 switches.",
        "Generally synonymous with port mirroring."
