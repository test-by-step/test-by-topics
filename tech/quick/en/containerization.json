    "description":"Containerization is the packaging of software code with just the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code to create a single lightweight executable—called a container—that runs consistently on any infrastructure.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "More portable and efficient than VMs.",
        "Containerization may be referred to as OS-level virtualization.",
        "Containers create isolated user-space instances for each application container.",
        "Containers can be used to run multiple applications that would otherwise have dependency conflicts on a single system.",
        "Containers enable scalability.",
        "With containers, application faults are isolated to the container run time and are less likely to cause a system crash that affects other applications.",
        "Containers are isolated and improve security by preventing a security flaw in one application being used to transition to other applications.",
        "Containers make use of the host kernel.",
        "Containers use less overhead than VMs.",
        "virtualization creates an instance of an entire system or operating system with its own kernel that runs on top of and/or is managed by a hypervisor."
