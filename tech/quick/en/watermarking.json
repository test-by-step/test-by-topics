        "Watermarking is a passive data loss mitigation measure", 
        "Watermarking is associated with data loss detection.",
        "Typically, a watermark will indicate ownership or source of a file.",
        "Source tracking uses watermarks to identify the source of data loss by imparting small variations in the watermark of distributed copies of data.",
        "Digital watermarks are typically hidden, causing imperceptible changes to the data or media that they are embedded in.",
        "Watermarks may be interrupted by modifications of the file.",
        "Identification of a digital watermark is often dependent on a known algorithm to expose, but is not cryptographic or 'secure'."
