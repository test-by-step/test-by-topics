        "Autoscaling is an automated or automations process.",
        "Autoscaling is closely associated with cloud services.",
        "Autoscaling can scale vertically or horizontally.",
        "Autoscaling for cloud services is often related to on-demand or pay-as-you-go services in which the client organization only pays for the resources they use.",
        "The minimum size is the minimum amount of resources that will ever be provisioned for the system. Autoscaling will not reduce resources below this point.",
        "The maximum size is the most amount of resources ever to be provisioned for the system. Autoscaling will not add resources above this point.",
        "Autoscaling can also involve **scheduled scaling** in which scaling happens on a pre-defined schedule, in order to anticipate changes in network traffic based on historical data."
