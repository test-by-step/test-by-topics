    "key-ideas":[
        "Scalability provides Availability.",
        "IT scalability may account for: CPU, network, memory, buffer, data storage, and database transaction capacities.",
        "Efficiency of algorithms is increasingly important as systems scale; e.g. latency of time required to process big data as data grows.",
        "Difficulty of Manageability of systems (in human cost and complexity) increases with scale.",
        "Scalability can account for increase in demand, adding resources to the system to accommodate; and decreases, releasing resources as demand ebbs.",
        "Automation is often used to dynamically provision and de-provision resources on-demand.",
        "Scalability is a key benefit of cloud computing.",
        "On-demand scalability allows cloud customers to automatically add and remove resources, only paying for what they use."
