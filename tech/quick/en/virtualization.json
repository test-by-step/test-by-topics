    "description":"In computing, virtualization is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Virtualized instances are separated from the underlying hardware.",
        "Hardware resource access is managed and scheduled by a hypervisor.",
        "Type 1 Hypervisors, or bare metal hypervisors, run directly on top of the hardware without a primary host operating system.",
        "Type 2 Hypervisors run as applications within a primary operating system, with virtual machines being invoked by the system or user.",
        "Type 1 is lighter and may be more efficient as it doesn't need to share scheduling with a host OS.",
        "Virtualization can virtualize: operating systems, appliances (firewalls, IDs, etc.), network devices (routers, switches, etc.), servers, destops, etc.",
        "Full virtualization virtualizes hardware components or aspects as well, such as unique instruction sets on different CPUs.",
        "Virtualization creates an instance of an entire operating system and kernel.",
        "VMs have more overhead than containers.",
        "VMs are more versatile than containers as they are not dependent on the host kernel."
