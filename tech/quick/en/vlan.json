        "Breaks up broadcast domains.",
        "Interfaces with different VLANs cannot be switched directly between eachother; VLANs on a layer 2 switch are mutually exclusive.",
        "Communication between VLANs requires a layer 3 device.",
        "Access links allow access for a single end-use device with a single VLAN.",
        "Trunk links allows a link to aggregate various VLAN traffic onto a single link for transmission to an adjacent switch, where traffic is again separated into their appropriate VLANs.",
        "IEEE 802.1Q is the standard that specifies how ethernet frames are tagged with VLAN numbers in order to be labeled (using a frame header called 802.1Q header), so the can be properly switched after traversing a trunk.",
        "VLANs provide improved efficiency and scalability for less cost, as subnets can be created without the need for new hardware or reconfiguring the physical connections on existing hardware.",
        "VLANs provide inherent additional security as VLANs segment the network so that a compromised device cannot see devices outside its VLAN."
