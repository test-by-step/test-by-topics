        "Used to execute untested or untrusted code or applications from untrusted third parties.",
        "Used in virus research in order to execute and study viruses without exposing real systems to them.",
        "Used to create secure development environments where software errors do not propogate, and malicous code or dependencies cannot be injected into the development process.",
        "Virtual Machines can act as logically sandboxes, but must be properly configured as hypervisors typically contain features that allow bi-directional communications.",
        "Operating Systems typically have mechanisms to sandbox applications, only providing access to restricted memory, storage space, system resources.",
        "Mobile Operating systems typically implement full application isolation on every application.",
        "Browsers must isolate individual tabs, windows, and pages (including embedded iframes) to prevent malicous pages from accessing another page."
