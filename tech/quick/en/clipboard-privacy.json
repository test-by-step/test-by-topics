    "description":"Clipboards allow users to copy data with the intent of pasting it elsewhere. Poor protections on the clipboard may allow malicious applications to access data that should be protected.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Typically, operating systems limit clipboard access to the foreground applications only.",
        "Any application that is responsible for copying sensitive information to the clipboard should automatically clear the clipboard after a short timeout.",
        "Cloud clipboard capabilities, or clipboards that are shared across devices, should be disabled.",
        "Password managers that bypass the clipboard and insert passwords directly into the input field may be preferred.",
        "In some mobile operating systems clipboards are typically implemented by the keyboard application, which must be vetted."
