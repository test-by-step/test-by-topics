    "description":"Data loss prevention, or DLP, is a set of technologies, products, and techniques that are designed to stop sensitive information from leaving an organization.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Network DLP watches data in motion as it traverses the organizational network and is positioned at the perimiter of the organization to stop protected data from exfiltrating the network.",
        "Endpoint DLP protects data on endpoint devices in the organization by using an agent software on the endpoint.",
        "Endpoint DLP is most associated with data in use, data at rest, but can watch for data in motion as it attempts to leave the endpoint.",
        "Cloud DLP shares the features of Network DLP, but is provisioned by the cloud service provider (CSP) and connected via Software Defined Networking.",
        "Encryption, either encrypted connections or encrypted files or filesystems, can prevent DLP applications from properly identifying data.",
        "Steganography attempts to circumvent DLP by hiding data in other innocuous files, such as in images; it is NOT encryption.",
        "DLP may take active protection measures by quarentining or delaying actions until approved, blocking actions or connections, and/or deleting files or stripping/replacing sensitive data from files or filesystems and connections."
