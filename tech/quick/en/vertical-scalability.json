    "description":"Scaling vertically (up/down) means adding resources to (or removing resources from) a single node, typically involving the addition of CPUs, memory or storage to a single computer.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Scale by improving existing nodes (add more RAM, add a more powerful CPU, e.g.).",
        "Improves resiliency and availability but does NOT improve redundancy.",
        "Vertical scaling can be preferred when the cost of adding new nodes is too high.",
        "Vertical scaling may be physical (more RAM on a blade server) or virtualized (more RAM assigned to a VM by a hypervisor)."
