        "SNMP message that alerts network managers to internal events observed by the agent (network device).",
        "Trap messages are distinguished as being asynchronous/unsolicited; instead of the management station intiating respones, the network device (agent) alerts the manager as soon as the event occurs.",
        "Traps can be either generic, defined in the RFC, or Enterprise Specific, created by the vendor or manufacturer for other custom events.",
        "Managers require a Management Information Database (MIB) with corresponding Object IDs (OIDs) in order to understand enterprise specific traps."
