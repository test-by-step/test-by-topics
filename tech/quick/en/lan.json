    "description":"A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "LANs connected devices and networks that share a common scope, typically an organization, campus, or business.",
        "Typically a collection of many collaborating sub-networks with a local or private address space.",
        "Physical LANs are typically restricted to a limited geographic area, but remote stations can be pulled in to the LAN with VPNs.",
        "LANs cannot connect to or communicate with other adjacent LANs without attaching to a Wide Area Network to route between them.",
        "LANs are almost always associated with Layer 1, 2, and 3 (physical, data link, and network).",
        "Local Area Networks can be virtualized in cloud with SDN, however this is not referred to as Virtual Local Area Networks.",
        "Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are logical segmentations that managed switches can specify on an interface-by-interface basis that prevents interfaces on different VLANs from communicating, functionally creating new subnetworks."
