        "A two firewall solution that creates a semi-public subnet between the internal organization's network and the external Internet.",
        "Two or more firewalls, different from screened host firewall, which is a single firewall creating two subnets.",
        "Allows protected public access to public servers such as for web or mail, while preventing public access to the internal network.",
        "Also called DMZ, demilitarized zone, perimeter network, or bastion hosts."
