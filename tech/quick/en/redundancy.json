    "description":"Redundancy is the intentional duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the goal of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Redundancy improves reliability by providing failover or back up for systems and components.",
        "Redundancy can improve performance by providing additional network paths or parallel processing power.",
        "Generally, redundancy provides resiliency, fault-tolerance, and availability.",
        "Failover occurs when a primary system fails and a backup or redundant system takes over as the primary servicer.",
        "Redundancy is strongly related to fault-tolerant systems as well as high availability systems.",
        "Redundancy can also be used for error detection.",
        "Redundancy focuses on reliability.",
        "Replication focuses on consistency.",
        "For replication, the state of the system must be synchronized between nodes (such as database back ups).",
        "Replicated systems are very often also redundant systems."
