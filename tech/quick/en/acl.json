    "description":"An access-control list (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a system resource (object). An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "ACLs are a sequence of rules, evaluated in order; evaluation stops once a rule matches conditions and executes its specified action.",
        "Can be applied to files, objects, database entries, active directory entries, or networks.",
        "ACLs can be applied to filter MAC addresses, IP addresses, or any other kind of traffic.",
        "ACLs are commonly implemented on network devices, such as wireless Access Points, switches, and routers.",
        "Network ACLs are packet filters that permit or deny traffic based on packet source and destination addresses, ports, and protocols.",
        "NAC Lists are packet-filter firewalls and typically a core feature of routers."
