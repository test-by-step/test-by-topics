    "description":"A stage, staging or pre-production environment is an environment for testing that exactly resembles a production environment. It seeks to mirror an actual production environment as closely as possible and may connect to other production services and data, such as databases.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Resembles live environments as closely as possible.",
        "Used to verify acceptability into the live environment and performance testing, verifying that application changes or additions will not cause application breaking behavior or security flaws.",
        "Not used for unit test of internal functions.",
        "Staging environments are placed after testing environments and before production.",
        "Closely related to SDLC (primarily software)."
