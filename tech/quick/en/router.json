    "description":"A router[a] is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Routers connect multiple packet-switched or routable networks",
        "Routers break of broadcast domains",
        "Routers discover nearby networks in order to build a table of possible routes",
        "Routers maintain a table of routing information to decide which interface to forward traffic on",
        "Autonomous Systems (ASs) are logically arranged systems of networks, typically managed by a single proponent and the networks internally are routed by IGPs. Communication between ASs are routed by EGPs.",
        "Internet is formed by linking ASs together, including backbone networks to local ISPs",
        "Packet filter firewalls can often be found on routers",
        "In-band management involves remote access to configuration of the device via the same interfaces and routes accessible and used by standard traffic.",
        "Out-of-band management involves management via either a physical interface, or a remotely accessible interface that is not accessible to standard traffic.",
        "SNMP is a common network monitoring/management protocol for network devices",
        "NETCONF is a protocol that some devices implement to remotely install and modify network configurations using an XML definition known as YANG."
