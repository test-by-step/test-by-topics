    "description":"A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.",

        "VPNs allow remote users access to private internal/corporate network.",
        "Split tunneling allows some traffic to be routed over a VPN connection, and the rest to travel on the open network.",
        "VPNs create tunnels using IPSec.",
        "Likely to be paired with NAC before allowing connection to network.",
        "Provides Confidentiality ONLY over the Internet, not internally.",
        "Does not implicitly provide integrity."
