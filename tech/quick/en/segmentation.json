    "description":"Segmentation divides a computer network into smaller parts. The purpose is to improve network performance and security. Other terms that often mean the same thing are network segregation, network partitioning, and network isolation.",
    "key-ideas":[
        "Physical segmentation partitions network portions using physical hardware such as switches and routers and the physical connections linking them together.",
        "Logical segmentation relies on rules, routes, vlans, and subnets to define network behaviors that force segmentation as traffic is moved about the network.",
        "VLANs segment Local Area Networks based on data link (layer 2) layer configurations.",
        "IP subnets segment Local Area Networks based on network layer (layer 3) layer 3 configurations.",
        "Access control lists also segment networks based on layer 3 (network) rules.",
        "Next generation firewalls can segment networks up through application (7) layer.",
        "Improves performance by limiting broadcast scope and propogation."
