    "key-ideas":[
        "Playbooks are sets of automated actions executed when triggered by rules defined by the COA Orchestration or SOAR appliance.",
        "Course of Action Orchestration is highly related to Security Ochestration and Automated Response (SOAR).",
        "SIEM collects and correlates incidents and events, and generates alerts.",
        "COA Orchestration and SOAR initiate specific sets of network actions based on alerts generated by SIEM.",
        "COA Orchestration reduces response time to network events, potentially reducing Mean Time To Detect and to Respond.",
        "COA Orchestration is more closely associated with automated failovers, recoveries from failures, response to performance degredation due to legitimate use, and response of non-security related system events.",
        "SOAR is distinct from COA Orchestration in that it focuses on security events and responses, rather than system resiliency."
