# Watermarking

Digital watermarking is a process that subtly or invisibly adds or embeds a mark or signature to a file or bundle that identifies the source of file.

Watermarking is a passive data loss mitigation measure, associated with data loss detection.

Typically, a watermark will indicate ownership of a file.

By imparting small variations of a watermark for otherwise identical duplications of a file, it may be possible to track the source (**source tracking**) of a data leak by tracking where or who a watermark was distributed to.

Digital watermarks are typically hidden, causing imperceptible changes to the data or media that they are embedded in.

Watermarks may be deliberately visible. Visible watermarks typically serve to dissuade unauthorized use of the data.

Identification of a digital watermark is often dependent on a known algorithm to expose, making them unaccessible to outside parties without significant analysis or resources.

Watermarks may be interrupted by modifications of the file, such as compression or cleaning of meta / exif data.
