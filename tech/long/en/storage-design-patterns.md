# Storage Design Patterns

Storage design patterns incorporate efficient data storage and data security into application design from the beginning of the development lifecycle through rigorous planning and the implementation of best practices and procedures at every stage of development.

Storage Design Patterns ensure that data is properly identified, classified, and compartmentalized.

Storage design should ensure that data from different classification levels do not intermix.

Storage design should ensure that sensitive data is encrypted to the appropriate level.

Storage design should ensure that data is handled in accordance with national or international laws and regulations.

Storage design should plan for data sovereignity, the concept that data is subject to the jurisdiction of the nation within whose boundaries the data is physically located.
