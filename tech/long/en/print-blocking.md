# Print Blocking

Printing may be a way for a malicous or untrained user to leak data out of an organization.

Information physically printed avoid organizational technical controls.

An organization may block printing to prevent data loss.

Alternatively a specialized print server could add a layer of protection where printing can be restricted, controlled and scanned while still allowing the printing where necessary.
