# Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technical control that encodes special protections in to meidea files and embeds digital media with special meta data indicating rights ownership.

DRM protects the ownership of proprietary data and media.

DRM may be applied by:
- preventing sharing / forwarding of data 
- Setting a time to live, limiting time or number of accesses for data
- Limit access based on IP, or physical location
- apply watermarks

Much DRM requires the collaboration of official softwares to be applied effectively.

DRM can be enforced in many ways:
- License key registration to enable full software access
- Persistant online session registration to enable software access
- Encryption
- Watermarks
- Embedded codes

Generally, commercial media software (music/video players, ebook readers) will enforce support for DRM controls embedded in the media.

Some media can be encrypted with keys managed by publishers or distributors (online music stores, e.g.) requiring the playback or display application to connect to a server to verify the rights and download the key to unlock the media.
