# Clustering

Clustering is the grouping of systems that work together as a single entity to perform a service.

Clustering is the grouping of equipment, services, or objects such as servers, databases, data, or network devices, based their characteristics in order to improve performance or reliability of the service by spreading service load and capacity over multiple service processors.

Clustering improves reliability and is a key enabler for high availability.

Clustering enables scalability.

Clustering can enable failover when clustering redundant systems.

Clustering is most often referenced regarding computing, such as clustering servers and databases, but may occaisonally be referenced for machine learning.

Key cluster computing focuses:

* Performance: cluster additional computational resources to perform advanced and complicated computational tasks
* Load-balancing: distribute service requests among identical back end servers
* Availability: HA clusters provide multiple failover protections through redundant or replicated systems

Open clusters are clusters where each cluster node is individually addressed and must independantly negotiate collaboration with other clustered nodes.

Closed clusters are clusters where nodes are positioned behind a single gateway that receives and routes requests.

Where large or powerful processing systems are required, clustering can enable them for cheaper by connecting less expensive systems; repairing and replacing systems is also cheaper when the less expensive components fail.
