# Air Gap

Air Gap is a networking security practice in which a network is physically disconnected and separated from all other networks and connections, and there is no link (wired or wireless) between the two networks.

Air Gap is generally considered the strongest network security measure as it is impossible for an outside connection from any external network or the Internet to penetrate into an air gapped network. Air Gaps do not prevent insider threats, and proper Physical Security is still required.

In an air gapped network access is restricted via **physical** disconnection and isolation, rather than logical isolation.

Some devices have active wireless radios (such as for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth), even when an active connection has not been established. For some high-security situations, it may be necessary to arrange TEMPEST shielding or Farraday cages to block all wireless traffic.
