# Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is a process and/or appliance that automates response to network security events by triaging incidents, threats, and alerts in the network and automatically initiating remedial actions in pre-defined playbooks.

Playbooks are sets of automated remedial actions, defined by the network administrators, that security appliances execute when triggered by the COA/SOAR rules.

SOAR is an autoamted or automations process.

SOAR is often referenced as part of incidence response or incident management.

SOAR is somewhat related to Course of Action Orchestration.

SOAR is distinct from Course of Action Orchestration as it focuses on responding to, isolating, mitigating, or preventing security events using automated actions on a network-wide scope. COA Orchestration is focused on failover and/or system recovery due to failures within the network or system.

SOAR is closely related to SIEM.

SOAR products consume network alerts and triggers, typically from a SIEM application, and begin automatic remedial actions on a network-wide scope.

SOAR reduces the Mean time to respond to security incidents by reducing the Mean Time to Respond to the event by not requiring manual human interaction to intervene.

SOAR Responsibilities are:

* Prioritize and categorize Threats
* **Triage** threats based on priority
* Respond automatically to threats

SOAR can use machine learning to develop response measures to incidents.

## Key Aspects

SOAR synchronizes and consumes the outputs and actions of multiple tools and technologies to perform well informed, **orchestrated** actions.

SOAR intiates **automated** remedial actions without the need for human interaction, reducing the time required to intervene in an active threat.

SOAR takes actions to **respond** to specific threat behaviors, intelligently isolating and acting to mitigate the effects, reduce the damage, or out right prevent an attack before it can proliferate.
