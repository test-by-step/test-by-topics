# Software Assurance

Software Assurance aims to rigorously test, document, and demonstrate the performance, security, and proper operation of an application to a pre-detirmined standard, demonstrating to a high degree of confidence that the software is free from errors, vulnerabilities, or shortcomings.

The goal of Software Assurance is to provide certain guarantees as to the proper security and working of software according to specifications in contracts, industry standards, or regulatory requirements.

Software in heavily regulated environments may need to be certified.

Software Assurances requires:

* Rigorous Documentation
* Security by Design
* Secure and stable dependencies
* Validated published packages (using digital signatures)
* Rigorous testing

Software Assurance occurs:

* Before development (planning and design)
* During development (documentation, application review, testing, dependency review)
* After development (Testing, certification, code signing)
