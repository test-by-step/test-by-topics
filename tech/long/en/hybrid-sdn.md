# Hybrid SDN

A hybrid SDN is a network environment in which a traditional network structure (read: routers, and switches either physical or virtual) is combined with SDN protocols.

For data centers, this typically means implementation of a more complicated infrastructure fabric of fully capable routers and switches that can act as a fall back if the SDN controller fails or becomes somehow corrupted.

This may also be realized by attaching network devices (real or virtual) as appliances in the SDN to allow for transitioning into a standard network environment.
