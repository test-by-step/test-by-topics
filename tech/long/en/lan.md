# Local Area Network (LAN)

Local area networks are computer networks that connect devices, virtual machines, applications, and other sub-networks that belong to or collaborate within a limited area or scope.

Local area networks are typically owned, managed, and/or operated by a single organizational entity such as business, school, or home. Physical local area networks are often defined geographically, though can be interconnected using virtual private networks and tunnels.

Network addresses within a local area network (LAN) are typically only meaningful (routable) within the local network - they are not, themselves routable to other networks on the Internet or able to communicate with other Local Area Networks.

In contrast, a Wide Area Network (WAN) connects a large spread of disperate local networks to allow network routing between these networks. WAN will typically also refer to a wide geographic area.

LANs are almost always associated with layer 1, 2, and 3 (physical, data link, and network) technologies.

They are typically defined by their physical connections, the links that connect interface-to-interface, the switched connections that can be logically segmented into addtional virtual LANs, and the subnets that define routing within the LAN.

## VLANs

Virtual Local Area Networks are logically defined (rather than physically assembled) local area networks that can be configured by network administrators to further segment LANs into sub-networks without the need for additional physical hardware, or altering physical configurations.

VLANs are most closely associated with layer 2 (data link) switching technology and switches specifically. Managed switches can define VLANs for individual interfaces which logically separate them from other interfaces that do not share the same VLAN.

Virtual Local Area Networks are NOT a cloud computing virtual network concept; Local Area Networks can be virutalized in a cloud network using Software Defined Networking but that is not what VLANs refer to.
