# Spiral

The Spiral Model of software development combines aspects of the iterative approach favored by agile-based development methods and the sequential method of a waterfall approach.

Spiral allows for rapid development and iterative release of new software versions, where each release has a clear set of objectives.

The Spiral method is conceptually a series of cycles, each cycle corresponding to a software version or release, logically organized into four parts per cycle.

1. Objective setting
1. Risk assessment and reduction
1. Development and validation
1. Planning

The development phase additionally incorporates many of the sequential waterfall approach steps:
1. Design
1. Code
1. Integration
1. Test
1. Implement

Thus, the spiral method allows the software package to be broken down into a series of sequential releases that can be iterated.

Objectives are clearly defined within each release cycle, which permits for a structured sequential approach to delivering on the cycles objectives.

Spiral models are often risk-driven, incorporating risk reduction and analysis often.

## Advantages

Risk focused.

Good at handling unclear requirements.

## Disadvantages

Doesn't fully take advantage of any of the benefits of iterative or sequential approaches.
