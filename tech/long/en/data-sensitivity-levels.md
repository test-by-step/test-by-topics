# Data Sensitivity Levels

Data sensitivity levels classifies data by assigning it to a security level. Security Levels allows finer data governance and the ability to apply different rules to more sensitive data, and often manage and govern through automation. 

Some levels are assessed by business policy and risk appetite for the organization but some may be mandatory based on law, standard, or regulation. Government classified data, for example, will need to be placed in a very high security level, and Personal Health Information (PHI) has many regulatory requirements for its storage and prcoessing.

Security Levels will mandate how data has to be stored while at rest, processed while in use, and secured while in transit. With properly constructed data sensitivity levels, much of this process can be governed automatically.

Different Security Levels may mandate a certain level of encryption, or restrict access to only users with a specific role.

Government agencies may use a system such as: Unclassified, Classified, Secret, Top Secret.

Public companies may use a system such as: Public, Internal, Confidential, Private

A more generic example may be: Low Sensitivity, Medium Sensitivity, High Sensitivity

Different organizations can have different names for data classification, and sensitivity levels can often be custom levels, but in general the levels follow a graduating pattern.

These levels are generic and an organizations levels might be more or less and blend at the edges.

## Level 1 - Public Information

Public information is information that is freely shared, and often deliberately published for public consumption.

Sharing of the information would cause no harm to any individual or the organization.

## Level 2 - Electively Confidential Information

Data which is unlikely to cause harm, or only very moderate harm, to an individual or the organization but which the organization has otherwise elected to keep private.

Data may be electively kept private to protect building configurations, equipment or other inventories, unpublished work, and other information that would be non-damaging alone but which may be collected together to make a more damaging data package.

## Level 3 - Harmful Information

Data which could cause a recognizable or material harm to the organization or individuals.

Data which may have some regulatory or legal requirements to protect such as PII or financial information.

Disclosure of this data may open the organization to civil liability.

## Level 4 - Serious Harm Information

Data which could cause significant harm to an individual or organization if lost or disclosed.

This may include heavily controlled and regulated information such as Social Security Numbers, Credit Card Information, Health Care Information, Financial Information.

In particular, data canbe graduated into this level when combined from lower levels, for instance some financial information combined with the name of the person associated with the information may make the information more damaging.

## Level 5 - Severe or Critical Harm

Data which may be associated with criminal liability or other sever or critical damage.

Loss or leakage of data which may consitute insider trading may be an example.

Government classified data (Secret, Top Secret e.g.).
