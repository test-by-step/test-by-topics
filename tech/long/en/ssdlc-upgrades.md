# Insertions and Upgrades (SSDLC)

Upgrades, insertions, and patching are crucial elements of maintaining application security and keeping software up to date.

Even after an application has been released or installed with reasonable guarantee of security, the security of the upgrades and patches must be similarly guaranteed for the application to maintain its security.

Changes must be thoroughly documented for each insertion, upgrade, or patch.

All insertions, patches, and upgrades must be properly signed by the developer/vendor and the updater software/code needs to properly verify signatures during upgrade; this validates both that updates are coming from an approved source, and that the package was not altered or corrupted during transmission.
