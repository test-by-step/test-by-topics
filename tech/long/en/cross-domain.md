# Cross Domain Connections / Cross Domain Solutions

Cross domain solutions are a limited connection between two security domains through a controlled interface.

Security Domains are network systems, typically logically or physically isolated, which share a security classification level, for example: an Unclassified network, a Secret network, or a Top Secret network; or Public, Confidential, and Private.

Cross domain solutions must always have very clear rules as to how traffic and information is permitted to move through the interface adjoining the two domains, and a security appliance (hardware or software) that enforces the policies. 

As an example: a cross domain solution between an unclassified network (lower classification) and a secret network (higher classification) may permit PDF files to be uploaded from the unclassified network to the secret network, but strictly prohibits any data from being downloaded from secret to unclassified networks.

A key element of cross domain solutions is a security appliance that is positioned at the junction of the two domains which enforces security policies.

From the perspective of any one domain, cross domain solutions enable a connection between the trusted domain (inside) and an untrusted domain (outside). The interface at the domain juncture, then, must evaluate all incoming data from the untrusted side to detirmine if it is acceptable to enter the network, as well as evaluate all outgoing data from the trusted side to evaluate if it is allowed to leave.
