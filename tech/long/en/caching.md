# Caching

Caching creates a copy of frequently accessed resources, storing it in a location that can be quickly and efficiently accessed upon request.

Caching primarily improves performance.

Caching can help improve reliability, availability.

In networks, caching will typically involve distributed systems and/or proxies in which static resources, or frequently accessed dynamic content, is temporarily stored in geographically dispersed servers so that they can very quickly and efficiently be served to clients in the same local area.

Caching improves performance by:

* Reducing latency in delivering content by placing content geographically closer to requesting clients
* Reduce computational load on back end by re-serving saved responses that have been processed by a previous request

Caching is often used in:

* Databases to quickly access frequently used data points
* Web sites and applications to quickly serve frequently accessed files or temporarily save and serve dynamic content to spare back end re-computation
* Computer processors to improve memory access times by temporarily storing data closer to the CPU
* In web browsers to save static content locally instead of redownloading over the internet
