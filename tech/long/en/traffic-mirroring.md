# Traffic Mirroring

Traffic Mirroring is used to copy (or mirror) network traffic from other or all interfaces onto a single interface.

Traffic mirroring is used to scan and log traffic and is used extensively in Intrusion Detection, activity monitoring and can be used in threat hunting and forensices.

Traffic mirroring can be especially useful for cases where traffic would otherwise be logically segmented for security, making it impossible to monitor all traffic from an isolated single device. Traffic mirroring allows for all traffic to be processed without requiring traffic to be routed otherwise isolated networks and VLANs.

Traffic mirroring can be accomplished using 
* Span ports
* Port mirroring
* Network taps
* On virtual private clouds
