# Waterfall

The Waterfall software development method is a static, linear approach to software development where development follows a defined, staged approach to planning for and delivering a software product.

With the waterfall approach, all requirements are evaluated up front, and development of the complete product happens at once, delivering a single complete product at the end of the process.

Waterfall approach is less iterative, and less flexible than other processes based on Agile principles.

Waterfall approach is more stable, easier to budget and estimate time and personnel requirements.

1. Requirements - critical to waterfall approach, as requirements are needed in full, upfront
1. Analysis - Requirements are assessed for viability, cost, priority, and responsibilities
1. Design - A good, complete plan, upfront, is required for waterfall to be effective
1. Implementation (Coding) - development of the entire application is done at once, to be delivered in full
1. Verification/Testing
1. Deployment
1. Maintenance

## Advantages

A long standing method, with demonstrated effectiveness in many cases.

Rigorous upfront design allows for early assessment of design shortcomings, reducing faulty code or misappropriated development time.

Costs can be more accurately estimated.

New requirements that would delay a product are not often added.

## Disadvantages

Less flexible, highly resistant to changing requirements.

Projects can take a long time to deliver.

A delay in one phase, delays all other phases.

Less client involvement in middle stages.
