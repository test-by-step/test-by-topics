# Vertical Scalability

Horizontal Scalability, also called scale-up, provides resiliancy and improves availability and performance by adding improving the servicing capacity or resource capacity of an already existing system.

Vertical Scaling with add (up scale) or remove (down scale) resources for a single node in order to scale its performance.

Vertical Scaling improves resliency to high resource demands, but does NOT improve redundancy.

As an example, vertical Scaling may add a more power CPU, additional RAM, or additional network interfaces to a currently configured server.

Vertical scaling can be physical, as in physically adding more RAM to hardware, but can also be virtualized, where more RAM may be apportioned to a VM by the hypervisor.
