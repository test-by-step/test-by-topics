# Vertical Scalability

Vertical Scalability, also called scale-up, improves, resiliency, availability and performance by adding to or improving the servicing/resource capacity of an already existing system.

Vertical Scaling will add (up scale) or remove (down scale) resources for a single node or instance in order to accomodate real demand.

Vertical Scaling improves resliency to high resource demands, but does NOT improve redundancy.

As an example, vertical Scaling may add a more powerful CPU, additional RAM, or additional network interfaces to a currently configured server.

Vertical scaling can be physical, as in physically adding more RAM to hardware, but can also be virtualized, where, for example more RAM is apportioned to a VM by the hypervisor.

Vertical scaling may be preferred when the cost of adding an additional node is prohibitively expensive.
