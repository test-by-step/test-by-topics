# Microsegmentation

Microsegmentation is a network segmentation concept closely linked to virtual cloud networks, software defined networks, and application workloads in which systems, networks, and organizational units are portioned into the smallest possible segments for their business function.

It is primarily a security concept.

Microsegmentation is also closely associated with Software Defined Networking (SDN) in cloud environments, which can easily overlay the complex connections required for many small segments over a static physical hardware without requiring physical configuration.

Microsegmentation is also closely associated with least-privilege and zero trust, since interactions between systems and segments can be limited to only those services and traffic which is explicitly permitted to pass through the requisite segments to accomplish its function.

Microsegmentation may also be enforced by an agent software installed on endpoints. Agent based solutions can enforce segmentation policies on an application and device level.

## Workloads

Microsegmentation is most often formed around workloads, which are all the processes, devices, resources, and services required for an application to perform a task.

Microsegments are usually formed around these workloads, so that they can work efficiently and freely together, but in relative isolation from outside influence.

## Benefits

Improved performance within segments.

Breach containment: when an intrusion is detected, SOAR, SDN, and other automations can be leveraged to automatically isolate a network segment, containing the incident and preventing proliferation.
