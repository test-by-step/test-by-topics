# Internet Gateway

An internet gateway the device that connects a discrete network to the wider interconnected Internet.

This device is often a router, but can be distinct as a device that connects disparate routing protocols or connection times.

A DSL or cable gateway is an example of an Internet gateway that connects a local IP network to the Internet via existing phone or cable infrastructure.

Internet Gateways may also convert other non-IP formats to internet-routeable formats such as Bluetooth or AppleTalk.
