# Sensors

Sensors are network devices that observe, monitor, detect, log, notify, and/or intervene with and in the network. They are typically mitigation devices implemented to protect networks and devices.

Sensors most often refer to the mechanisms, processes, and technologies by which alerts and notifications are generated rather than to the systems or devices.

Examples of sensors are:
* SIEM - generates alerts and notifications based on consolidated log input and correlation of network activity indicating compromise
* File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) - generates alerts and notifications based on changes to files
* SNMP traps - alerts and notifications based on triggers defined for routers
* NetFlow - forwards network metrics to a centralized location for monitoring and analysis
* DLP - detects sensitive (PII, PHI), proprietary, or regulated data moving through the network and attempts to intervene
* Anitvirus - detects virus signs moving through the network and attempts to prevent proliferation
