# Integration Testing

Integration testing is the testing of software conducted by combining related or co-dependent modules and components and testing them as group to verify proper function.

Integration testing occurs after unit testing has verified components and functions behave properly, independently.

Integration testing verifies inputs, outputs, and proper error/exception handling.

## Big Bang Integration Testing

All components are combined into one big test.

## Incremental

Testing starts with a minimum of two modules, after testing passes then related modules are added and tests are run again, and so on until all modules are tested.

## Top-down

Top level modules are tested first, then lower level modules are added and tested.

## Bottom-up

Lower level modules are tested first, then upper modules are added and tested.

## Sandwich

Testing is focused on a target layer.

Integration testing tests the integration between the target layer and the layer above, and the integration between the target layer and the layer below the target layer.
