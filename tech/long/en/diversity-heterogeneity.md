# Diversity vs. Heterogeneity

Diversity in the context of IT, networks, and cyber security is the deployment of technologies from multiple vendors that perform the same or a similar function through out the organizational network. For example, some routers from Cisco and some routers from Juniper; or, some cloud services from Microsoft Azure and some from AWS.

Heterogeneity is the focus on or exclusive use of a single vendor for a given purpose throughout the organizational network. For example, using only Palo Alto firewalls for the entire network; or, using only Google Cloud.

Benefits of diversity are:

* Avoid vendor lock in
* Vendor specific vulnerabilities are not shared across entire network

Drawbacks of diversity are:

* More complex and more difficult to manage network
* Some devices from different vendors may not work well together, or not at all

Benefits of heterogeneity

* Simpler network structure
* May be cheaper to scale

Drawbacks of heterogeneity

* Potential for vendor lock in
* Vender specific vulenerabilities will affect entire network

## Vendor Lock In

Vendor lock in occurs when an over reliance and/or prohibitive cost of change causes an organization to be stuck dependent on a single vendor for providing critical cyber functions.

Vendor lock in is undesirable because vendors may suddenly change prices or even go out of business, leaving the organization with no option but to pay the outsized cost for service or to switch vendors.

Vendor lock in is most likely to occur when an organization pursues a heterogenious approach to deploying applications and devices.
