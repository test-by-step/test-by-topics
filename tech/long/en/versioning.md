# Versioning

Versioning is the process or custom of giving a unique identifier (usually a number) to a particular release or version of a software.

Typically with versioning, changes in core functions or behavior will not occur in between versions. 

While patches may be applied to cover security or critical bugs between versions, major changes are typically not enacted without a specific version change.

Versioning may be:
* internal - in which a revision number tracks the changes to the code base
* external - in which a version number identifies official released software packages

Versioning is often divided into Major and Minor versions, with patches being applied in between.

Significant changes in the software may be a cause for an organization to change versions. Minor changes, such as those that affect layout and quality of service but do not change function, are often minor version changes. Major changes, typically those that change function or break compatiability with older versions, are often indicated by major version changes.

Major version numbers are sometimes used to group compatible applications and supplicants: e.g. all clients and servers that use the same major will be able to communicate. Though breaking changes are possible between minor versions, and different major versions may still be compatible.

Organizations that sell software versions as packages, rather than subscriptions, may also use major versions as distinct licensed products. Minor version changes are applied to the purchased application at no cost, but any major version changes could require a new software license to be purchased and installed.

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is a common approach to version identification which a three part scheme to indicate major, minor, and patch release numbers: Major.Minor.Patch.

## Calendar Versioning

Uses the date of release as the verion number: e.g. 2022.10 would be a software version released in October 2022.
