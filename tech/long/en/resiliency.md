# Resiliency

In the context of IT, resiliency is the ability of an application or service to maintain its capability to process and respond to service requests, even under heavy demand or when attacked.

Resiliency is focused on ensuring an application continues to function appropriately, as intended, and without interruption even when conditions rapidly or drastically change or when disruptive conditions threaten some aspect of the application's system backend.

Resiliency may be related to Business Continuity Planning, but is often considered for its own merits as well.

Resiliency is often highly related to: High Availability (HA), scalability, redundancy, and automated remediation techniques.

Resilient systems should avoid or eliminate single points of failure.

Some examples of reslient stategies could be:
* Fail over when things break
* Adjust resource allocation to meet sudden changes in demand
* Back up generators for data centers
* RAID storage to replace and fix data corruption inline

Resliency attempts to mitigate disruptive conditions such as:
* Component failures
* Sudden rises in service requests
* Sudden increases in network traffic
* Natural disasters
* DoS attacks
* Hacking attempts
