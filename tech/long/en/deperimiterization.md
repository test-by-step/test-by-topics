# Deperimiterization

Deperimiterization is the process or trend towards the dispersion of business assets, employees, or resources outside of the organizations physical or on-premesis network perimiter.

It is most often associated in context with securing legitimate and essential remote and external connections back into the trusted or protected parts of the organizational network.

Large and growing organizations may have offices or employees spread across a wide area who need to connect back to corporate resources that are normally isolated to the Local Area Network.

## Key Ideas

All connections back into the network need to be strongly authenticated.

All connections should use secure protocols.

All connections should use strong or sufficient encryption.

Data-level authentication should be used, meaning that once the connection is established, it is not implicitly granted access to all resources, but that each action and request has to be explicitly verified and permitted. 

Consider a Zero Trust architecture for deperimiterization, assuming all connections are inherently a threat.
