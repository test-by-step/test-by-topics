# Availability Zones

Availability zones is a segmentation technique used primarily with cloud services in order to separate data and resouces physically within geographic regions and data centers.

Availability zones improve fault tolerance by spreading physical resources across physically separate and isolated blocks within a region, so that if one isolated zone encounters an issue, it can quickly and efficiently fail over or restore from the isolated zone that exists physically in the same region.
