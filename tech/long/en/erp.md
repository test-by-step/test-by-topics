# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a suite or collection of softwares that collects business data from applications across the organization, and consolidates, categorizes and analyzes the data.

ERP provides a continuous, often real-time view of business processes and resources available across the system or inventory.

ERP improves business performance and efficiency.

ERP can track:
* cash / money
* raw materials
* production capacity
* orders
* payroll

ERP facilitates data flow between departments and disparate applications that may not otherwise communicate directly.

ERP provides a single, integrated system for viewing (and in some cases possibly automating responses) various business applications, amalgamating data into a common database.

Combine data from various departments through modules:
* Financial / accounting - general ledger
* Accounting - budgeting
* Human resources - recruiting, training, payroll
* Manufacturing - materials, engineering, scheduling
* Order processing
* Supply chain
* Project management
* CRM - sales, marketing, customer contact
