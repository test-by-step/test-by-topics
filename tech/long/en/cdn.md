# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Content Delivery Networks are distributed server systems that are specially configured to respond to requests for files and resources from servers that are geographically close to the source of the client request.

CDNs are geographically distributed proxies in that static resources are cached at remote locations and served upon request on behalf of the primary server system.

CDNs improve permance by distributing request load across multiple systems and data centers.

CDNs can improve availability, high availability, fault tolerance, and reliability by providing alternative or back up systems to serve requests if an outage occurs at a different data center in CDN network.

CDNs can deliver static resources for websites, stream data such as video and audio, proxy database responses, and much more.

CDNs are extremely versatile and capable of hosting a wide array of proxied services.

CDNs may be referenced or related to edge computing, in that CDNs provide access to application services by responding to requests at the border of the service network.

CDNs improve reliability and availability.

CDNs improve scalability.

CDNs reduce latency and network congestion.
