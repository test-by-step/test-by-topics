# Fielding (SSDLC)

The secure fielding, deployment, and implementation of software requires a standardized and rigorous process to demonstrate viability, acceptability, freedom from errors, freedom from vulnerabilities, and minimization of integration or implementation impact.

Software must be tested for security before release or fielding.

Software should be validated in a separate staging environment where it is tested for integration and thoroughly scanned for vulnerabilities using DAST, SAST, and/or IAST.

Releases should be thoroughly documented.

A bug tracking process should be implemented to register critical bugs and vulnerabilities.

Distributions should be signed using code signing techniques to provide integrity checks for customers.

An implement for secure and easy application of security patches should be available.
