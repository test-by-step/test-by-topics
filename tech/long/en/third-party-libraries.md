# Third Party Libraries

Third party libraries are standardized or pre-built dependencies for software applications that greatly improve the speed and effiency of software development by providing common core features that do not need ot be re-created for each new application.

Third Party Libraries are often referred to as dependencies.

Applications will often 'depend' on a library and will also require a specific version or versions of the library.

Third Party Libraries can be: Open Source, meaning their source code is publicly available for review, modification, and redistribution; Closed Source, meaning that their source code is not available for review; and/or Proprietary, meaning that the organization developing the library retains all rights to the library that cannot be modified or redistributed without their permission or license - this almost always means closed source.
