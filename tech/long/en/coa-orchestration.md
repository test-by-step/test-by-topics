# Course of Action Orchestration

Course of Action Orchestration automates the process of responding to network event occurances through pre-established playbooks.

Playbooks are sets of automated remedial actions, defined by the network administrators, that security appliances execute when triggered by the COA/SOAR rules.

Course of Action Orchestration is highly related to Security Ochestration and Automated Response (SOAR).

COA Orchestration and SOAR are distinct from SIEM but related. SIEM collects and correlates incidents and events, and generates alerts. COAO and SOAR initiate specific sets of network actions based on alerts generated by SIEM.

COA Orchestration reduces response time to network events, potentially reducing Mean Time To Detect and to Respond.
