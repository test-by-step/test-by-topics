# Distributed Allocation

Distributed allocation spreads systems and applications over multiple equipment pools or data centers in order to improve resiliency.

Resources and equipment concentrated in an isolated geograhpic area or single data center is susceptible to total service disruption if a natural disaster, power blackout, internet service blackout, or other wide area disruptive event occurs.

Resources can be distributed by the creation of multiple data centers or spreading applications across multiple servers for self-hosted services, or by provisioning resources in multiple cloud regions if using cloud services.

Distributed allocation may also be used on a local scale by spreading critical applications and services over multiple devices or systems.
