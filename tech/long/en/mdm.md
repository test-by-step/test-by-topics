# Mobile Device Management (MDM)

Mobile Device Management is an application that runs on mobile devices, it can be part of the operating itself but often is provided by a third-party application, which enforces security policies specified by the organization for its use for corporate/organizational business.

MDM is a key enabler for **scalability** with regards to mobile devices and large organizations. MDM is essential for securing large numbers of mobile devices for large organizations, where the individual management of devices would be prohibitive.

MDM can automatically install and configure required applications, apply security policies and restrictions, configure certificates and VPNs, configuring and enforcing device encryption and compartmentalization, and many more security features.

Policies and configurations for MDM enabled devices can be delivered and downloaded 'over-the-air' such that the device can be configured remotely or without direct IT intervention. Policies can also be updated dynamically, after initial configuration.

MDM is the most common broad-scope security concept to be related to mobile devices.

MDM can be used to track inventory both by logging activity and physically tracking using GPS/location services, and can be used to configure a device to remotely wipe aall data if it is lost or stolen.

MDM is related to NAC and serve similar functions, however NAC does not inherently enforce device policies, it restricts network access based on evaluated adherence to policies. MDM fully enforces defined policies.
