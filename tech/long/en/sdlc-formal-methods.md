# Formal Methods (SDLC)

Formal methods include frameworks and patterns for planning and mplementing security in the software development process.

Implementing security in the SDLC should begin in the planning stage.

Software should be "Secure by Design" meaning that security should be part of the design from the beginning, and security features should be implemented inline with core application functionality.

The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is sometimes references as a process for producing secure-by-design applications.

Security in the SDLC:

* Use standard / well-vetted security frameworks
* Implement and adhere to a risk management framework
* Conduct frequent testing as part of CI/CD
* Use an external audit to review security

## Secure Software Design Framework (SSDF)

The secure software design framework is a collection of fundamentals, best practices, and patterns from NIST that provide a framework for implementing secure software design.

SSDF Practices:
* Prepare the Organization
* Protect the Software
* Produce well sourced software
* Respond to vulnerabilities

The objective is to help software developers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in published software.

SSDF leverages other secure software principles from other organizations to create a generalized framework.

## Software Application Maturity Model (SAMM)

The Software Application Maturity Model (SAMM, or OpenSAMM) is an open framework from OWASP for organizing, formulating, assessing, and implementing security in a application development.

It allows an organization to apply some objective metrics to the development and SDLC outputs in order to provide some guarantees to the security of the application.

* Evaluate existing software
* Build a balanced security program
* Demonstrate improvements
* Measure security activities in the organization

## SAFECode

SAFECode is another organization that offers frameworks and training for secure software development practices.
