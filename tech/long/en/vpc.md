# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Virtual Private Clouds are computational networks that host a suite of remotely administered services; most noteably: cloud networks, virtual machines and servers, databases, security appliances, gateways, and other specialized computing services.

Virtual Private Clouds take advantage of economies of scale to cheaply provide vast amounts of computational and networking resources that are administered remotely (note that this can be provided by a third part, e.g. AWS or Azure or self hosted, though third party has become much more popular and expected).

Virtual Private Clouds allow the client organization to remotely provision and define a wide array of networked services through which all the traffic in the organization is routed through, albeit from a remote location.

VPCs make use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to create a virtual network that can be configured to behave in a multitude of logical arrangements, while allowing the underlying hardware to remain in a static configuration
