# Horizontal Scalability

Horizontal Scalability, also called scale-out, provides resiliancy and improves availability by adding additional components, nodes, devices, or instances to distribute service load over a greater number of service providers.

Horizontal Scalability improves availability and also provides redundancy.

A horizontal scaling solution might, for example, add additional physical servers to a load balanced server pool to handle a large CPU load of server requests, or add additional routers to handle a large number of network connections.

Horizontal scalability is important when system work loads exceed the capacity of even immensely powerful computers, such as in large social networks or big-data search engines.

Horizontal Scalability may also allow for physical geographic distribution of resources, which also improves resliancy to disasters or localized failures.
