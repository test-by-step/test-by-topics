# SDN Overlay

The SDN Overlay is the abstract, self-contained and self-governing arrangement of logical paths that is created by software in Software Defined Networking, and then translated onto the existing network hardware. The software defined network paths is then said to be 'overlayed' onto the infrastructure hardware.

An Overlay is any purpose built, logically defined, self-contained traffic routing and governing protocol or system that is built on top of a pre-existing general-purpose infrastructure or protocol of an otherwise similar purpose.

For example, Peer-to-peer networking is an overlay network. Peer-to-peer networking is a purpose-built protocol for connecting participating nodes that creates a self-contained ecosystem of participating peers, connecting nodes directly to each other, with the whole network being built on top of the existing TCP/IP Internet network.

In SDN a logically defined datapath is constructed that is self-contained (it only makes sense and is routable inside of the SDN) and is overlayed (translated) onto the underlying hardware, which already exists.
