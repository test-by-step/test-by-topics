# Port Mirroring

Port Mirroring copies traffic from a specific interface or VLAN onto another port. It is closely associated with SPAN ports, and is commonly used as a generic term for SPAN ports.

Port mirroring operates at layer 2 and is almost always associated with switches, while bridges and hubs are more closely associated with network taps as there is no distinction between a mirrored port and other ports on these devices.

Port mirroring is typically used in association with network monitoring devices and IDSs to view all aggregated traffic on the network that would otherwise not be visible accross logically segmented interfaces via VLANs.
