# Restricted virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) implementation

VDI allows desktop resources to be hosted in a cloud environment rather than on premesis, however this inherently permits some data to leave the company perimiter increasing the risk of data loss.

Generally, VDI should disable copy and paste features between virtual remote systems and the local desktop.

VDI should not allow printing unless through a print server to controlled printers.

VDI should disable screenshoting or screen recording where possible.
