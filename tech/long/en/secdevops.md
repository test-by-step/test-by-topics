# SecDevOps

Secure Development Operations (SecDevOps) is the integration of secure software planning and development into every stage of the software development lifecycle.

With SecDevOps software must be Secure By Design.

SecDevOps enables all teams to integrate security requirements and control into their components.

Security requirements are either made the responsibility of the existing team, or a security integrations team member is added or designated for the team.

SecDevOps incorporates automatic security controls, testing, and review into the development lifecycle.

SecDevOps makes frequent use of SAST, DAST, and IAST, integrating them into CI/CD pipelines.

SecDevOps includes proper security training and education of team members.

SecDevOps moves security considerations from the end (sometimes referred to as the right) of development to the beginning (the left).
