# Configuration Management Database (CMDB)

Configuration Mangement Databses (CMDB) are databases that store information regarding an organizations hardware and software inventory, and the settings, configurations, and state of the assets.

CMDB is used to manage asset inventory (HW and SW) and the relationships between them.

CMDB can assist in identifying and managing critical assets within the organization.

CMDB can also be used to identify baseline and expected system states and configurations within the organization.

CMDB can be used for **change management** in which a rigorous validation processes is enacted before any change to the system configuration is accepted. With a CMDB, it may also be possible to roll back or reconfigure to a known good state registered as a checkpoint or snapshot within the database in the event of errors.

Items in the CMDB are called Configuration Items (CI).
