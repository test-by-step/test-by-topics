# Requirements (SSDLC)

Software should be secure by design, meaning that security should be included in the planning and requirements gathering phases of software develpment.

Ensure that security requirements for software development are known at all times so that they can be taken into account throughout the SDLC and duplication of effort can be minimized because the requirements information can be collected once
and shared. This includes requirements from internal sources (e.g., the organizationâ€™s policies, business objectives, and risk management strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable
laws and regulations). [2]

Requirements must be documented and maintained over time.

Requirements must be planned for from the beginning.

Requirements must be implemented continously and at every stage of develpment.

Requirements must be assessed, re-assessed, and tested at every stage of development.

Requirements should be:
* testable
* measurable
* complete (fully defined, and covering entire scope)
* clear and unambiguous
* consistent 

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are something that the application MUST do.

A functional requirement is an action the application takes to mitigate or enforce a security control.

### Nonfunctional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are (typically subjective) requirements that do not require active enforcement by the application.

Non-functional requirements will often define expectations of outputs, behaviors, or formatting that support auditing or transparency.

### Derived or Implied Requirements

Derived requirements are requirements that are implied based on other requirements or requirements mandated by policy, regulation, or law.
