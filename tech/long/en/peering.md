# Peering

Peering, in the context of networks and security, is the mutual, voluntary connection of two separate, independantly administered networks to exchange traffic and data on an equal basis between them.

Users and devices of either network can exchange data and/or traffic through and between both networks as if they were native users on either.

In peering, neither organization pays the other for the service and traffic is exchanged on an equally privileged basis. Each retains and bills its own customers independantly, though traffic from either customer is passed freely and without discrimination.

Consider as an example, two Internet Service Providers who have large backbone networks such as AT&T and Verizon (their internet backbone, rather than cell coverage). Instead of each building comprehensive nation-wide backbone internet infrastructure, they agree to interconnect their independent networks, merging their exclusive geographic coverage, enabling their customers access to the entire connected network without the need to build new exclusive infrastructure in the area.

The same principle can be executed on smaller, local scales, and between organizations.

Peering is most often associated with physical interconnections between routing systems that negotiate routing between networks via BGP. It is possible to peer remote networks through IP tunnels or VPNs.
