# Regression Testing

Regression testing is the rigorous testing (or re-testing) of an application or parts of an application after changes have been applied to verify that the software still behaves as specified and expected.

Regression testing is applied after updates or changes to **already approved software or components**.

Regression testing is frequently automated.

Regression testing tests functional and non-functional components for consistent behavior.
