# Agile

Agile Software Development is a set of software development principles which aim to improve software development quality and value by tightly coupling the collaboration of developers, business leaders, and customers.

Generally, Agile is not set procedure but a set of principles and guidelines that underly the creation of a formal, flexible process that fits the needs and can be molded to the benefit of each development team and project.

Important aspects of Agile are:

* Continuous and frequent software delivery 
* Cooperation between business leaders and developers
* Simplicity
* Welcome changing requirements
* Self-organizing teams.

With Agile processes, work-flows, and methods are highly customized by each team, for their purposes, and to meet their needs. These processes are consstantly reassesed and altered as needed.

With agile, software is delivered often.

Scrum and Kanban are two frameworks with defined methodologies that are largely constructed around the Agile principles.

## Values

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
