# Container APIs

Container APIs allow for the efficient and centralized management and orchestration of large-scale container deployments through the use of configuration templates and controller applications.

Container APIs allow for the efficient orchestration of containers.

Container APIs are closely associated with cloud services.

Container APIs provide an access, reporting, and management interface to access, assess and configure containers in bulk.
* High availability applications are deployed on multiple container instances in order to increase the reliability of the application as a whole. 
* Some systems may be composed of multiple applications, requiring many different types of containers increaseing the complexity of the system.
* Many microservices are deployed in containers; there may be large numbers of required services, and thus containers

High density container deployments can be accessed and monitored through APIs which report on the activity, behavior, load, and health of the container.

Container APIs also allow container deployments to be easily configured in a text configuration file that specifies the container behavior, for example: number of containers of this type, load-balancing algorithm, maximum number of containers, minimum number of containers, and thresholds to trigger the creation of additional containers.

Kubernetes is a popular example of a Container management and orchestration software.

Container APIs must be secured against unauthorized access.
