# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

SIEMs are consolidation points for network and device activity and event logs.

The distinctive function of SIEMs is **correlation**. SIEMs aggregate logs from devices and services across the network into one location and analyzes them together to look of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

SIEM is a combination Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM).

SIEM can and does use automations and often learning algorithms to generate reports, alerts, and notifications to help identify security threats before, during, and after intrusions. 

SIEMs provide a dashboard to view and manage the aggregated alerts, events, logs, threats, IoCs, and metrics. This provides a centralized view for the organization and is likely to be used in a Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Key Functions

* Security Alerts
* Event Correlation
* Log Management
* User and Entity Behavior Analitics (UEBA)

## Detecting Threats

As a correlation tool, SIEMs can help identify many threats including:
* Insider threats (unusual, suspicious, or malicous behavior)
* Injection attacks (SQL, LDAP, Command)
* DoS
* Data loss / data exfiltration

## Related Ideas

* Forensics - SIEMs can be especially useful for forensics as they aggregate logs, as well as mark potential IoCs
