# Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and Acquisitions between two organizations involve the joining of both organizations networks, infrastructure, assets, and information systems. This process is exceptionally risk prone and requires a rigorous process of due dilligence and care to protect both information systems and networks as they are combined.

During a merger/acquisition the proper configuration and security of the network must be verified *before* the networks are merged. This involves many expectations on the part of both parties.

During any merger or acquisition a few key things are expected:
1. Risk Assessment should be performed
1. Legal Requirements should be evaluated
1. Review Disaster Recovery, Incidence Response, Business Continuity Plans
1. Review assets and inventory
1. Review physical security

Things that may also be expected:
1. Penetration testing
1. Compromise assessment
1. Inventory analysis

## Due Dilligence

Due Dilligence is a key concept, primarily for acquisitions.

Due dilligence, in an IT and security context, is a legally binding process in which an organization evaluates, inventories, and guarantees the proper configuration and security of assets and systems prior to the purchase or merger of a new organization.

Due Dilligence is associated with specific functions, processes, regulations and policies. It will have well defined expectations for specific functions, features, systems, and processes.

This is typically most associated as a rigorous function of the acquiring organization. The acquired organization is expected to fully comply with all due dilligence expectations.

## Due Care

Due Care is a key concept for any merger or acquisition.

Due Care is the (non-legally binding) and generic expectation of any organization to ensure that their inventory, systems, and processes are up to standard and/or follow best practice.

Due Care is usually described as the care and processing a reasonable person would be expected to maintain over the organizational systems and inventory.

All organizations are expected to execute due care of their network and assets, but will often be associated with the responsibilities expected of the acquired organization.
