# Staging Environment

Staging environments are application/system development ecosystems positioned just before deployment to production or public use environments. They are established to mimic the production ecosystem in order to verify functionality and security of the application/system integration under real use before it is made available for public/production access.

Staging environments are most closely related to software development and the software development life cycle, but can refer to staging areas for data in data lakes/zones.

Staging environments are placed after testing environments but before production. They are NOT used for unit testing of internal functions but to verify integration into a real-world environment, ensuring that no breaking changes will be made, that the application will remain secure, and that all features behave as intended.

Applications that have been accepted into staging can be deployed using automated tools on a fixed or rotational schedule to manage down time and efficiently roll back or interrupt deployment in the case of issues.

Staging environments allow for careful auditing and testing of the functionality of application changes or addtions in a near-real-world situation to ensure they do not break the application upon deployment.

Staging Environments allow for final validation before being moved to production.

## Key Ideas

Staging Environments mimic production environments as closely as possible.

Staging Environments are most closely related to the SDLC, (software most often, but also system).

Staging Environments are used for final validation, auditing, and performance checks before the application is allowed to be moved into the production (public use) environment.

Staging Environments are placed after Testing Environments but before Production Environments.

Staging Environments are not used for unit tests of internal functions, but for validation of acceptability into the real-world/production environment.
