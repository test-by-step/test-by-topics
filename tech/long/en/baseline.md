# Baseline

In IT, a baseline is a standard common default configuration of settings, policies, permissions, software, operating systems, and/or versions that is used as a common secure expected setup to compare other systems or future changes against.

Baselines are formally approved configurations.

Baselines require formal change control procedures to alter; every change must be documented, assessed, tested, and approved.

Baselines are closely associated with configuration management.

Baselines are typically intended to ensure security of a system.

Baselines are often considered secure configuration at a point in time.

Baselines can be applied to system configurations such as with computers and servers (operating system & OS version, installed software, applied policies, permissions etc.).

Baselines can be applied to software development where a version of the software, or even a component of the software, is formally approved. If a change has to be made in the baselined portion of the software, the change must go through a formal and rigorous review before being approved as a new baseline.

With networks involving multiple systems on a common baseline, changes to individual systems are sometimes permitted. Individual system deviations from an expected baseline, however, must to be approved, documented, and registered.

Network Vulnerability scanners, Network Access Control scanners, and NAC agents may check network devices against the baseline configurations for deviations. Devices that deviate from the baseline and don't have an approved exemption may be blocked from the network or otherwise flagged for investigation.
