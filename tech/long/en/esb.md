## Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)

Enterprise Services Buses act as a common medium for network and system applications across an organization to communicate between themselves and to share information, regardless of operating protocol or standard of the end appliance.

ESBs are platform agnostic and ideally integrate any application or service in any environment.

An ESB is a software application that functionally provides an abstraction layer so that individual applications do not need to implement multiple collaborative communicative interfaces or protocols. 

Instead, the ESB is responsible for receiving, translating, and delivering messages and data between applications connected to the bus.

ESBs are highly related to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), as an ESB is typically used as a common abstraction layer to connect communications and requests between SOA applications.

ESBs:

* Route messages from service to service
* Monitor message exchange
* Resolve contention between communicating services
* Control deployment of services
* Data transformation
